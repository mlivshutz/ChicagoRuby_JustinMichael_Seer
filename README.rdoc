This sample project demonstrates the variety of chart types that {Seer}[http://github.com/Bantik/seer/] is capable of generating.

The sample project requires a SQLite database in order to function; be sure to run rake db:setup to simultaneously create the database and seed it with sample data.

It has been modified during Chicago Ruby meetup Hack Night meetup.
